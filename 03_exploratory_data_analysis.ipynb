    "At this point, you should have a firm idea of what your data science problem is and have the data you believe could help solve it. The business problem was a general one of modeling resort revenue. The data you started with contained some ticket price values, but with a number of missing values that led to several rows being dropped completely. You also had two kinds of ticket price. There were also some obvious issues with some of the other features in the data that, for example, led to one column being completely dropped, a data error corrected, and some other rows dropped. You also obtained some additional US state population and size data with which to augment the dataset, which also required some cleaning.\n",

    "New York dominates the area of skiing available at night. Looking at the top five in general, they are all the more northerly states. Is night skiing in and of itself an appeal to customers, or is a consequence of simply trying to extend the skiing day where days are shorter? Is New York's domination here because it's trying to maximize its appeal to visitors who'd travel a shorter distance for a shorter visit? You'll find the data generates more (good) questions rather than answering them. This is a positive sign! You might ask your executive sponsor or data provider for some additional data about typical length of stays at these resorts, although you might end up with data that is very granular and most likely proprietary to each resort. A useful level of granularity might be \"number of day tickets\" and \"number of weekly passes\" sold."

The states with the most total days skiing per season are not necessarily those with the most resorts. And New York State boasts an especially large night skiing area. New York had the most resorts but wasn't in the top five largest states, so the reason for it having the most resorts can't be simply having lots of space for them. New York has the second largest population behind California. Perhaps many resorts have sprung up in New York because of the population size? Does this mean there is a high competition between resorts in New York State, fighting for customers and thus keeping prices down? You're not concerned, per se, with the absolute size or population of a state, but you could be interested in the ratio of resorts serving a given population or a given area.\n",

You've constructed some potentially useful and business relevant features, derived from summary statistics, for each of the states you're concerned with.

This technique will find linear combinations of the original features that are uncorrelated with one another and order them by the amount of variance they explain. You can use these derived features to visualize the data in a lower dimension (e.g. 2 down from 7) and know how much variance the representation explains. You can also explore how the original features contribute to these derived features."

You can also see that you've introduced a lot of multicollinearity with your new ratio features; they are negatively correlated with the number of resorts in each state. This latter observation makes sense! If you increase the number of resorts in a state, the share of all the other state features will drop for each. An interesting observation in this region of the heatmap is that there is some positive correlation between the ratio of night skiing area with the number of resorts per capita. In other words, it seems that when resorts are more densely located with population, more night skiing is provided.\n",

    "Turning your attention to your target feature, `AdultWeekend` ticket price, you see quite a few reasonable correlations. `fastQuads` stands out, along with `Runs` and `Snow Making_ac`. The last one is interesting. Visitors would seem to value more guaranteed snow, which would cost in terms of snow making equipment, which would drive prices and costs up. Of the new features, `resort_night_skiing_state_ratio` seems the most correlated with ticket price. If this is true, then perhaps seizing a greater share of night skiing capacity is positive for the price a resort can charge.\n",

    "As well as `Runs`, `total_chairs` is quite well correlated with ticket price. This is plausible; the more runs you have, the more chairs you'd need to ferry people to them!

People seem to put more value in guaranteed snow cover rather than more variable terrain area.\n",

When the value is low, there is quite a variability in ticket price, although it's capable of going quite high. Ticket price may drop a little before then climbing upwards as the number of resorts per capita increases. Ticket price could climb with the number of resorts serving a population because it indicates a popular area for skiing with plenty of demand. The lower ticket price when fewer resorts serve a population may similarly be because it's a less popular state for skiing. The high price for some resorts when resorts are rare (relative to the population size) may indicate areas where a small number of resorts can benefit from a monopoly effect. It's not a clear picture, although we have some interesting signs."
